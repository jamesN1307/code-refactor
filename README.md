Code Refactor HORISEON site
This site was designed to help me to understand and code HTML5, CSS and Git. During this challenge I was tasked with refactoring existing code to bring it up to a more accessible standard.


I learned the importance of clean code and while updating the site was able to remove a number of duplicate css rules. Overall this was a fun project and really helped sharpen my skills as a developer.
